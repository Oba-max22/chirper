# Chirper (Front End)
In this lab, you will be building your first front-end application using ReactJS.

It's called Chirper, a platform where you can post short messages on the internet for all the world -- even the Presidents of the United States -- to see!

## Instructions
* Your objective should be to create a "timeline" of Chirps -- short messages that you post on the Chirper platform.

* Your timeline should load with at least three chirps.

* Code a form with at least two inputs where users can submit new chirps from.

* When a new chirp is submitted it should be shown back to the user in the timeline.
